/*
    KineXus is the Main Component for the KineXus Engine
    This Engine is an interactive Canvas
    It has similar functionality to a 3D Engine, but is 2D
    It is designed to be used with React
    It has TriggerZones, MotionTrackers, and other components
    It has an Init(), Start(), Loop(), Update(), and Stop() function
    It has a Canvas, a Camera, and a Renderer
    It has a Scene, which contains all the objects
    It has a Physics Engine, which is Matter.js
    It has a Sound Engine, which is Tone.js

    The user will be given an objective in the scene
    The user will have to complete the objective
    The user will be given a score based on how well they did
    The user will be given a time limit to complete the objective

    The user input will be tracked by the MotionTracker
